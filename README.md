# EducationScholarshipSystem

Education Scholarship System is a platform for providing the scholarships to the students who are interested in doing any course from any particular educational institute. 

Institute needs to register in the system, upload the test questions and answers and the related details like passing marks, scholarship detail etc. The student who like to do any course from the registered institute to this platform and wants scholarship then he/she needs to clear the test of that particular institute with the required marks. 

At the end of the test, the test score gets displayed, a student needs to take printout of that score card and should show to the institute in order to get the scholarship.

A student is allowed to give the test for a particular institute only once. 

Institute can change any of its information at any time, can see the list and details of the students who have given the test for that institute.

Project is using : JSP, Maven, Spring MVC framework, JPA, Javascript, Jquery.

I have made this project during the 4th year of my undergrad. This was a major project.
